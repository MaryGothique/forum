<h1>Cookies politique</h1>
    <p>
        To make the websites of the Publications Office of the European Union work properly, we sometimes place small data files called ‘cookies’ on your device.
What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

    First-party cookies are cookies set by the website you’re visiting. Only that website can read them. In addition, a website might potentially use external services, which also set their own cookies, known as third-party cookies.
    Persistent cookies are cookies that are saved on your computer and are not deleted automatically when you quit your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you quit your browser.

Every time you visit the Publications Office’s websites, you will be prompted to accept or refuse cookies.

Cookies can also be used to establish anonymised statistics about the browsing experience on our sites.
How do we use cookies?

The Publications Office websites mostly use ‘first-party cookies’. These are cookies set and controlled by the Publications Office, not by any external organisations.

However, to view some of our pages, you will have to accept cookies from external organisations.

You can delete or block these cookies, but if you do that, some features of this site may not work as intended. These cookies are used to remember:

    your display preferences, such as browsing language, contrast colour, font size, device used, search results preferences and notification preferences;
    your latest visit to the website (for statistical purposes) and the three most recent pages visited (to help our helpdesk if you send a request);
    if you have agreed (or not) to our use of cookies on this site.

Visitor preferences

These are set by us and only we can read them. They remember if you have agreed to (or refused) this site’s cookie policy.

Operational cookies

There are some cookies that we have to include in order for certain web pages to function. For this reason, they do not require your consent. In particular:

    authentication cookies;
    technical cookies required by certain IT systems.

Authentication cookies

These are stored when you log in to the Publications Office sites, using our authentication service (EU Login). When you do this, you accept the associated privacy policy​​ .
